# advanced_web344
these are projects from my advanced web dev class
Each project listed in this class has a different focus.
Project1 is primarily front-end focused. it just has HTML and CSS. there is no JS of PHP. 
Project2 focuses more on JS to make the page more dynamic. There is a little PHP to handle includes from common files like the header and footer. The front end asthetics are cut back a bit.
Project3 focuses on using PHP to handle some basic SQL calls. the front-end is very minimal.
